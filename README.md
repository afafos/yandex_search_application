# Yandex Search Application

This Python application utilizes the Yandex Maps API to perform searches based on various parameters. 
The application provides three search endpoints:

1. **Search by Name:** `/search_by_name`
2. **Search by Services:** `/search_by_services`
3. **Search by Address:** `/search_by_address`

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.x)
- Requests library (`pip install requests`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/afafos/yandex_search_application.git
   ```
2. Change into the project directory:

## Configuration

Before running the application, you need to obtain a Yandex Maps API key. 
You can get one by following the instructions on the Yandex Maps API documentation:
https://yandex.com/dev/maps/jsapi/doc/2.1/quick-start/index.html
